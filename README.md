# Space-Shooter-Lecture
A game from lecture.

## My Changes

- I replaced the location of the points to the left corner of the screen.
The points doesn't reset between scenes.
- I added a meteor storm. collision with a meteor cause the spaceship to move to random direction for less then one second, preventing the player control the spaceship.
